## Repository Details

### **\codes**
* Includes all primary code and the processed datasets generated by it (excluding the original dataset).
* `models.ipynb`: Handles the entire workflow; data cleaning, merging, feature engineering, train/test splits, EDA, hypothesis testing, modelling, model evaluation (including SHAP). This notebook contains all the main processing, analysis, and evaluation steps for the student dropout project.
* `dropout_dataset_generator.ipynb`: A utility script designed to automatically produce processed datasets for specific phases without rerunning the full pipeline in `models.ipynb`. It can generate a dataset for any chosen module timepoint (e.g., the first 10% of module completion).
* `student_dfs (CSVs)`: Contains the four processed datasets (early, midpoint, late, and full phases) generated using `dropout_dataset_generator.ipynb`. These datasets are used in `models.ipynb` for hypothesis testing, EDA, modelling, and evaluation tasks.

### **\documents**
- Contains drafts of the report.
- Contains Trello Kanban Board Dump as a JSON file called `dsp_project_trello_kanban_dump.json`.
- Contains drafts and the **oral presentation slides** in the `\presentation_drafts` subfolder.
- Contains the gantt chart and templates.
- The **final written report** is saved as `2605549_report.pdf`.
- The **oral presentation slides** are saved as `2605549_presentation.pdf`.

### **\img**
